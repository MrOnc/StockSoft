Purplonc Store - Sales and Inventory Management Application

Purplonc Store is a desktop application built with PyQt5 for managing sales, purchases, stock, and customer/supplier information in a store. The application provides a user-friendly interface for entering and viewing data in tabular format.

Key Features:
- Record purchases and sales with details such as date, product, quantity, and price.
- Maintain a stock table to track available quantities and average prices of products.
- Manage customer and supplier information with dedicated tables.
- Calculate profit/loss based on total sales revenue and purchase costs.
